# CS230-Final
The client The Gaming Room wanted to develop their game Draw It or Lose It into an online web-based game. The game needed to work on multiple different operating systems.

Within the document, the part I believe I made the most thorough was the design constraints. 

The whole process of making a design document makes it easy to outline what needs to be done and how to accomplish that. It also helps to outline the approach you need to take and what methods to use to complete it.

I would redo the evaluation section to make it more thorough.

The users needed to be able to play the game on multiple different types of devices. This is important to take into account as some of the devices users will be on will have less storage or slower processors so needed to make sure that a minimal amount of processing and storage was being done on the user's devices. You really need to understand who your users will be for your project to make sure you are building it in the correct way.
